#function that used
#string

string is the header file required for string functions. This function appends not more than n characters from the string pointed to by src to the end of the string pointed to by dest plus a terminating Null-character. The initial character of string(src) overwrites the Null-character present at the end of string(dest).

h is the header file required for string functions. This function appends not more than n characters from the string pointed to by src to the end of the string pointed to by dest plus a terminating Null-character.
<string> is a C++ standard library include, and <string. h> is C standard library include. ... The difference is: <cstring> wraps everything in the std namespace whereas <string. h> puts everything in the global namespace. Also, expect some stricter type safety rules from <cstring> .


#Time

The C++ <ctime> header file declares a set of functions, macros and types to work with date and time. For example, the time() function is used to get the current time.
The ctime() library in C++ converts the given time since epoch to a calendar local time and then to a character representation. A call to ctime(time) is a combination of asctime() and localtime() functions.


#conio.h

The conio. h is a non-standard header file used in C and C++ programming. This file contains console input-output functions 

#Switch

A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

#Goto

The C++ goto statement is also known as jump statement. It is used to transfer control to the other part of the program. It unconditionally jumps to the specified label. It can be used to transfer control from deeply nested loop or switch case label.

#Getch

We use a getch() function in a C/ C++ program to hold the output screen for some time until the user passes a key from the keyboard to exit the console screen. Using getch() function, we can hide the input character provided by the users in the ATM PIN, password, etc. Syntax: int getch(void);
getch() is a nonstandard function and is present in conio. h header file which is mostly used by MS-DOS compilers like Turbo C. It is not part of the C standard library or ISO C, nor is it defined by POSIX. Like these functions, getch() also reads a single character from the keyboard.

getch() is a way to get a user inputted character. It can be used to hold program execution, but the "holding" is simply a side-effect of its primary purpose, which is to wait until the user enters a character. getch() and getchar() are used to read a character from screen.


#Cls 

Clearing the terminal Screen: system("CLS"); When the screen is cleared in Visual C++, the cursor is moved to the upper left corner of the screen. To clear the screen in Visual C++, utilize the code: system("CLS"); The standard library header file <stdlib.
